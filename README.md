## online model

for intrusion detection system, online detecting is of importance to figure out possible attacks timely.



## offline model

However, offline models are the main topic discussed by a variety of papers. Currently, offline models can be divided into multi-level, 



### offline multi-level model

Currently, most multi-level models are actually multi-classification models. As we can see, most in-use classification algorithms are bi-classifications. There are multiple methods to extend them to multi-class algorithm, such as 1 vs all, 1 vs 1, tree. Generally speaking, those models

These methods will derive multiple levels in the multi-classification process.
