# learning based intrusion detection
multiple intrusion detection implementations using machine learning algorithms.

[TOC]

## online model

for intrusion detection system, online detecting is of importance to figure out possible attacks timely.



## offline model

However, offline models are the main topic discussed by a variety of papers. Currently, offline models can be divided into multi-level, 



### offline multi-level/hierarchical classification

Currently, most multi-level models are actually multi-classification models. As we can see, most in-use classification algorithms are bi-classifications. There are multiple methods to extend them to multi-class algorithm, such as 1 vs all, 1 vs 1, tree. Generally speaking, those models are just trying to divide original multiple class into 2 groups and apply classfication algorithm recursively. So these methods will derive multiple levels in the multi-classification process. 

![multi-level example](README/multi_level.png)

It's then freely to select classification algorithms at each level to achieve good performances. For example, use SVM at first level to distinguish A and B, then use ELM to separate A1 and A2, use multi-logistic to handle B1, B2, B3. Please notice, the combination of classification algorithms is totally free, we can even use  multi-classification model not only bi-classification model to process a particular level if with good performance. However, the choice of algorithm combinations is usually experiment inspired without a clear guide theory. 

It's clear that the so-called multi-level model is actually a hierarchical classification model, belonging the part of ensemble learning.



## Useful Stuffs

## preprocess

There are many types of preprocessing. We can preprocess data to have a high quality data subset to gain quicker speed and better accuarcy, or to make data subject to a certain distribution to meet the needs of algorithm, or to get rid of outlier, or to turn lexical features into numerical ones... Preprocess is important to led to a out-performanced model. Here are some of the most used skills for preprocessing:

+ Use clustering algorithm to reduce train dataset. clustering algorihtm such as k-means can change original data into clusters, then we can use the centroid to represent all the data in the same cluster, thus reducing the dataset size.

Examples:

+ modified_kmeans.py



### Feature Selection

For IDS, there are many side knowledge to help us choose and design features.

What are the useful features?

  **Remark:** This paper actually has done thing but change the classification methods in the framework of herachical classification. So this paper is too trivial and has little value. 

  **Worth Reading:** only Chapeter 3.2.

  **Remark:** This paper is just rubbish, I don't know why National Natural Science Foundation of China will support such a rubbish project.

+ Sharma A, Manzoor I, Kumar N. A Feature Reduced Intrusion Detection System Using ANN Classifier[J]. Expert Systems with Applications, 2017.

  **Remark:** Not good enough, but with good literature review. And it's feature preprocessing of KDD Cup data may have some reference value, especially the feature set the authors select.

+ Yuan G, Li B, Yao Y, et al. A deep learning enabled subspace spectral ensemble clustering approach for web anomaly detection[C]// International Joint Conference on Neural Networks. IEEE, 2017:3896-3903.

  **Remark:** Introduce semantic information of URL into detection and cluster anomalies into more concrete types. Have some value. 


**2016**:

  **Remark:** though has little theory value, but this article is **a quite good introduction paper** to dummies of NIDS.




### Trends

Following the papers concerning IDS, we can see mainly two directions.

1.  Along with the improvement of machine learning. From single classifier to ensemble, hybrid classifier; from feature learning to deep learning.
2.  Along with the security of pervasive computing. Wireless network, SCADA, Cloud and so on, need specific IDSs.

How machine learning based methods differ from traditional pattern matching methods? Think in Deep.
