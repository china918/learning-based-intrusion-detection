# learning based intrusion detection
multiple intrusion detection implementations using machine learning algorithms.

## online model

for intrusion detection system, online detecting is of importance to figure out possible attacks timely.



## offline model

However, offline models are the main topic discussed by a variety of papers. Currently, offline models can be divided into multi-level, 



### offline multi-level/hierarchical model

Currently, most multi-level models are actually multi-classification models. As we can see, most in-use classification algorithms are bi-classifications. There are multiple methods to extend them to multi-class algorithm, such as 1 vs all, 1 vs 1, tree. Generally speaking, those models are just trying to divide original multiple class into 2 groups and apply classfication algorithm recursively. So these methods will derive multiple levels in the multi-classification process. 

![multi-level example](README/multi_level.png)

It's then freely to select classification algorithms at each level to achieve good performances. For example, use SVM at first level to distinguish A and B, then use ELM to separate A1 and A2, use multi-logistic to handle B1, B2, B3. Please notice, the combination of classification algorithms is totally free, we can even use  multi-classification model not only bi-classification model to process a particular level if with good performance. However, the choice of algorithm combinations is usually experiment inspired without a clear guide theory. 

It's clear that the so-called multi-level model is actually a hierarchical classification model, belonging the part of ensemble learning.



## Useful Stuffs

## preprocess

There are many types of preprocessing. We can preprocess data to have a high quality data subset to gain quicker speed and better accuarcy, or to make data subject to a certain distribution to meet the needs of algorithm, or to get rid of outlier, or to turn lexical features into numerical ones... Preprocess is important to led to a out-performanced model.



### Feature Selection

For IDS, there are many side knowledge to help us choose and design features.
